# Architecture notes

The decisions and shared contracts that catalog, MCP, checkout and booking all build on.

## Database

- **Engine:** PostgreSQL 17, tested on 17.11. The migrations create the `btree_gist` extension.
- **Provider:** Render Postgres, because all hosting is already on Render. The code is plain Postgres with no provider-specific features, so moving to Supabase or Neon means changing `DATABASE_URL` and nothing else. [deployment.md](deployment.md) covers how it runs there.
- **Access:** [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) over `pg`. The schema is [`src/server/db/schema.ts`](../src/server/db/schema.ts).
- **Migrations:** SQL files in [`drizzle/`](../drizzle), generated from the schema with `npm run db:generate` and applied with `npm run db:migrate`. [`0001_invariants.sql`](../drizzle/0001_invariants.sql) is hand-written, for constraints Drizzle cannot express.

### Local setup

```bash
createdb agentshelf_dev
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the values below
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm test
```

Migrating and seeding are safe to repeat. The seed updates its own fixed rows and leaves everything else alone. It is a manual step, not part of a deploy, so a redeploy never resets demo data.

`npm test` needs a real Postgres server and creates and drops its own temporary database on it, never touching the database named in `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. It fails when that variable is missing rather than skipping tests. `npm run test:unit` runs the tests that need no database.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Read by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | app, `db:migrate`, `db:seed` | Postgres connection string |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | `npm test` | Connection string for a server where tests may create and drop databases |
| `APP_SIGNING_SECRET` | app | At least 32 random characters. Signs seller sessions and order status tokens, and changing it invalidates them |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | app | The public origin, such as `http://localhost:3000` locally. On Render it falls back to `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` |
| `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID_<REF>`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET_<REF>` | app, from [#6](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/6) | Sandbox credentials for the shop whose `paypal_credential_ref` is `<REF>`. [#2](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/2) may change this once the merchant model is proven |
| `DEMO_PHONE_WORKSHOP_PAYPAL_MERCHANT_ID` | `db:seed` | Optional. The demo shop's sandbox merchant. Its checkout returns `PAYMENT_NOT_CONFIGURED` until this is set |
| `DEMO_PHONE_WORKSHOP_SELLER_CODE` | `db:seed` | Optional. The demo shop's seller access code, stored only as a hash. Nobody can sign in until this is set |

## Rules the data model enforces

Most of these are database constraints, so they hold however a row gets written.

| Rule | Enforced by |
| --- | --- |
| Money is an integer number of minor units | `integer` columns, [`money.ts`](../src/server/domain/money.ts) for arithmetic and decimal conversion. EUR is the only supported currency for now |
| A row cannot mix shops | Composite foreign keys on `(id, shop_id)` from order lines and bookings |
| PayPal order, capture, product and webhook event IDs, merchant IDs and idempotency keys are unique | Unique constraints, across all shops |
| A published product has a price, and a published service also has a duration and deposit | Check constraints. A draft may leave these unknown |
| An order cannot be `paid` without a capture ID | `orders_paid_requires_capture` |
| An order's amount, currency and recipient never change, and its lines are never edited or deleted | `orders_terms_immutable` and `order_lines_immutable` triggers |
| One technician cannot have overlapping held or confirmed bookings | `bookings_technician_no_overlap` exclusion constraint |
| A booking cannot be `confirmed` without the capture recorded on its own order | `bookings_confirmed_requires_capture`, `bookings_order_capture_fk` |

Payment state lives on `orders` and booking state on `bookings`. Instants are stored in UTC, and a shop's IANA timezone (`Europe/Riga` for the demo shop) is used for display.

`shops.paypal_credential_ref` names a credential set held in environment variables and is never the credential itself. It and `shops.paypal_merchant_id` stay on the server.

## Service contracts

The Zod schemas in [`src/server/contracts/commerce.ts`](../src/server/contracts/commerce.ts) are the source of truth, shared by HTTP routes and MCP tools. Inputs are strict: a request carrying a total, price, merchant or any other unknown field is rejected, not ignored. Amounts are integer minor units and instants are ISO 8601 with an offset.

| Tool | Input | Result | Implemented in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `search_products` | `query`, `location?`, `maxPriceMinor?`, `currency?`, `limit?` | `products[]`: `productId`, `shopId`, `shopName`, `location`, `kind`, `title`, `description`, `priceMinor`, `currency`, `availability`, `serviceDurationMinutes`, `depositMinor` | [#5](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/5), [#10](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/10) |
| `get_slots` | `shopId`, `serviceId`, `from`, `to` | `slots[]`: `slotId`, `technicianId`, `startsAt`, `endsAt`, `timezone` | [#12](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/12) |
| `book_slot` | `slotId`, `serviceId`, `idempotencyKey` | `bookingId`, `orderId`, `expiresAt`, `approvalUrl`, `depositMinor`, `remainingMinor`, `currency`, `statusToken` | [#12](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/12) |
| `create_checkout` | `items[]`: `productId`, `quantity`; `idempotencyKey` | `orderId`, `totalMinor`, `currency`, `approvalUrl`, `statusToken` | [#6](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/6) |
| `get_order_status` | `orderId`, `statusToken` | `orderId`, `paymentStatus`, `totalMinor`, `currency`, `booking`, `updatedAt` | [#11](https://github.com/ever-guild/AgentShelf/issues/11) |

Services throw a `ServiceError` with a stable code from [`errors.ts`](../src/server/errors.ts). Its message and details are safe to return to a client.

These server pieces already exist for the issues above to build on:

- `quoteCheckout` resolves a cart to authoritative lines, total and recipient, and rejects mixed shops and products that are not on sale.
- `getPublishedProduct` and `listPublishedProducts` read the public catalog.
- `issueOrderStatusToken` and `verifyOrderStatusToken` provide the order capability. The token is derived with an HMAC, so an idempotent retry returns the same one and none are stored.

## Seller demo session

This is a minimal demo session, not a production identity system. `POST /api/seller/session` takes a shop slug and that shop's access code and sets a signed, `HttpOnly` cookie that lasts eight hours. `GET` returns the signed-in shop and `DELETE` signs out.

Naming a shop grants nothing. A seller route must get its shop from `requireSellerShop`, never from request input.
